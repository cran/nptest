Changes from ver 1.0-1 to ver 1.0-2  (2020-10-01)

1) np.boot (new function for nonparametric bootstrapping)
	* Provides bootstrap estimates of standard error and bias
	* Computes five different bootstrap confidence intervals

2) Update to package name (to reflect bootstrap extensions)
	* Previous name: Nonparametric Tests via Permutations
	* Updated name: Nonparametric Bootstrap and Permutation Tests




Changes from ver 1.0-0 to ver 1.0-1  (2020-09-10)

1) Added S3 plotting method for all nptest functions
	* Plots the permutation distribution and observed statistic
	* The rejection region is a separate color (default is red)
	* User input "alpha" controls rejection region (default is 0.05)

2) Added new reference to package and np.reg.test()
	* Only relevant for tests of regression coefficients
	* See Helwig (2019b) for details on regression tests
	* https://doi.org//10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116030

3) Update to the statistic df in np.cor.test for semi/partial correlations
	* Applicable when z is provided and independent = TRUE
	* Previously used a denominator that ignored the dimension of z
	* The correction does *not* affect the inferential results
          (because the correction is applied to statistic and perm.dist)

4) Update to the statistic df in np.reg.test with nuisance variables
	* Applicable when z is provided, homosced = TRUE, and method %in% c("HJ", "KC", "SW")
	* Previously used a denominator that ignored the dimension of z
	* The correction does *not* affect the inferential results
          (because the correction is applied to statistic and perm.dist)

5) Correction to example in the help file for np.cor.test
	* Previously used data generation code that only worked for rho = 0.5
	* Updated data generation code works for all values of rho

6) Update to package name (to clarify meaning of "Nonparametric Tests")
	* Previous name: Nonparametric Tests
	* Update name: Nonparametric Tests via Permutations
