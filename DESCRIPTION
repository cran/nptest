Description: Robust nonparametric bootstrap and permutation tests for location, correlation, and regression problems, as described in Helwig (2019a) <doi:10.1002/wics.1457> and Helwig (2019b) <doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116030>. Univariate and multivariate tests are supported. For each problem, exact tests and Monte Carlo approximations are available. Five different nonparametric bootstrap confidence intervals are implemented. Parallel computing is implemented via the 'parallel' package.
